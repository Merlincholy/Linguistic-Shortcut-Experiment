      `<p>Thank you for taking the time to participate in our study!
         This study is investigating a phenomenon known as the linguistic shortcut
          which involves the use of distributional, statistical patterns in language 
          during rapid conceptual processing. When given more time, individuals are able 
          to access the simulated system which offers deeper processing. We are curious if
           individuals will automatically switch between the linguistic shortcut and 
           the simulated system when they are given shorter and longer time constraints
            but not explicitly told to produce different responses. In other words, do we
             continue using the linguistic shortcut even without time constraints? 
             We hypothesize that individuals will switch between the two systems given
              the different time constraints.</p>`,
